# Kafka Producer — Stock Market Data Stream

This notebook acts as a **Kafka producer**: it reads stock market data from a processed CSV (`indexProcessed.csv`), samples one row per second, and publishes each row as a JSON message to the Kafka topic `stock-market-index`. Use it to simulate a real-time stream of stock index data into your Kafka cluster. Ensure the Kafka broker is running and the topic exists before executing. Run the consumer notebook in parallel (or on another machine) to read the same stream.
